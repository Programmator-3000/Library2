Due to capabilities, provided by GitHub, installation of this project can be executed in a few clicks. So, basicly, there is nothing to explain here.
I suppose, you need to know, what software and frameworks I`ve used during implementstion.
This project is a ASP.NET MVC 4 web-application, implemented by Visual Studio 2012. DataBase is created by MSSQL Server.

There are three types of users provided if this project:
1. Unregistered user, who doesn`t have actual access to the Library.
2. Regular reader, who has an opportunity to view books and take them.
3. Administrator, who can manage books any way he wants it.

List of exact user-accounts, I`ve created for testing, you can find on UserGuide page of the project.
